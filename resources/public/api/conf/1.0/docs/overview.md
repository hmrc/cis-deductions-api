Under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), contractors deduct money from a subcontractor’s payments and pass it to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The deductions count as advance payments towards the subcontractor’s tax and National Insurance.

This API allows the developer to:

* retrieve details of the data the contractor has submitted to HMRC 
* retrieve a list of CIS deductions
* create CIS deductions
* remove CIS deductions
* override previous CIS deductions (after the tax year has ended)

For information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/#overview].
